## Introduction

Building upon the success of [my first Pokémon Memory game](https://github.com/Zoilum/pokememory) developed in React, Pokémemory V2 is a completely unnecessary, overkilling Vue/Nuxt SSG app, that was used as a coding exercise to teach myself Nuxt, and refresh my Vue knowledge.

- **CSS3:** Styles the game elements, ensuring an attractive and visually appealing experience.
- **Vue:** Powers the interactive gameplay and logic behind Pokémemory V2.
